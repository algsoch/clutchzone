# ClutchZone Backend Status Report

## âœ… COMPLETED BACKEND FIXES

### 1. SQLAlchemy Model Issues Fixed
- **Problem**: SQLAlchemy model attributes were being treated as Column objects instead of actual values
- **Solution**: Used `getattr()` to safely access model attributes and `.update()` method for database updates
- **Files Fixed**:
  - `backend/routers/auth.py` - Fixed user registration, login, and authentication
  - `backend/routers/tournaments.py` - Fixed tournament CRUD operations
  - `backend/routers/players.py` - Fixed player profile and leaderboard operations
  - `backend/routers/admin.py` - Fixed admin operations and match result verification
  - `backend/auth.py` - Fixed authentication functions and role checks

### 2. Import Issues Resolved
- **Problem**: Relative imports were failing in router files
- **Solution**: Updated all imports to use relative imports (`from ..schemas import ...`)
- **Files Fixed**: All router files now properly import schemas and auth functions

### 3. Type Annotation Issues Fixed
- **Problem**: Optional parameters were incorrectly typed as `str = None`
- **Solution**: Changed to `Optional[str] = None` and added proper imports
- **Files Fixed**: All router files now have correct type annotations

### 4. Email Service Configuration Updated
- **Updated**: Brevo SMTP credentials with your provided settings
- **SMTP Server**: smtp-relay.brevo.com:587
- **Login**: 9220c3001@smtp-brevo.com
- **Password**: WcDQh3SgMVxjYZ8B
- **Files Updated**: 
  - `backend/services/email_service.py`
  - `backend/.env.example`
